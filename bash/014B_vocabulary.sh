# Makes a program output a lot of text in STDOUT

# Redirect that output to /tmp/output.txt
# open the file to see that your output is there

# Same but this time redirect to /dev/null
# You can NOT open that. /dev/null is a special thing, like a black hole where you redirect
# outputs you don't want
