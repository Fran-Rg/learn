# Write some programs you know just on their own and see what they show you
# if they expect more info they should usually show you a "help" text

# Use the program "which" to find where each program is located
which vi
which ls
which grep
which which
# Most of them should be inside /usr/bin but some others that you installed might be somewhere else
