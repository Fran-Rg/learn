# create a variable, with the name you want

# print out the first character of the string
# print out the last character of the string
# create a variable named "start" that contains the first character of the string

# create an empty array called "array_building"

# add the first character of the string to the array

# add the last character of the string to the array
# create an array call "array_built" that contains the first and last value of the string at creation

# create an empty dictionnary called "dict_building"
# add the variable "the_thing" at the key "TOTO"
# add the first character of the string to that dict at the key "MY_START"
# add the last character of the string to that dict at the key "MY_END"
